# Application for Exemption for Dependents of Employment Income Earner（給与所得者の扶養控除等申告書）

The conditions to be displayed on documents in both 2021 and 2022 are as follows.

:::tips
Single parent deductions were established and widow (widower) deductions were reviewed from the 2020 year-end adjustment. However, the "2021 Application for (Change in) Exemption for Dependents of Employment Income Earner" form released by the National Tax Agency has not been updated with the items that list single parent deductions and widow deductions, and the notation remains the same as before the revision.
It is assumed that the person submitting the form will correct the old description by hand. However, the 2021 Application for (Change in) Exemption for Dependents of Employment Income Earner created with SmartHR already supports descriptions for widow and single parent deductions.
