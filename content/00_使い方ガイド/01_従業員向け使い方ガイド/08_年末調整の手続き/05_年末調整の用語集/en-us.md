# Basic terminology

## Income（収入）

This refers to the salary and bonus received from a company when working at a company, and the revenue from a store when self-employed and running a store or similar business.

Income also includes profit due to payment in the form of company housing, food, gift vouchers, and other non-monetary payments.

## Earnings（所得）

"Earnings" is the amount after subtracting necessary expenses from income.

When working at a company, the monetary amount that results after subtracting the employment earnings deductible amount, the earnings amount adjustment deductible amount and the specified expenditure deductible amount from the income received from the company (the salary and bonus) is called "employment earnings."

## Withholding tax（源泉徴収）

Earners must calculate, declare and then pay their own tax amount based on that year's earnings.

When an earner is working at a company, the company that pays their salary can subtract the income tax from the employee's salary and then pay it to the government on behalf of the employee.
This is referred to as "withholding tax."

## Year-end adjustment（年末調整）

The amount of income tax, etc. withheld as tax from one year's salary and bonus paid to the employee by the company is checked against the annual amount of tax that the employee needs to pay, and the procedure to adjust any excess or deficiency is referred to as "year-end adjustment."

An explanation is provided at「[Types of deduction applications created during SmartHR year-end adjustment](https://knowledge.smarthr.jp/hc/ja/articles/360052694653#toc--29)」on this page about documents to submit in order to declare the deductible amount.

## Final tax return（確定申告）

While the year-end adjustment provides an exact calculation of the income tax for employment earnings, the final tax return provides an exact calculation of the income tax for all earnings that occurred in that year.

In principle, earners must file a final tax return. However, when working at a company, the year-end adjustment is used instead, which means that many people do not need to file a final tax return.

Please refer tot [No. 2020 Final tax return ｜ National Tax Agency](https://www.nta.go.jp/taxes/shiraberu/taxanswer/shotoku/2020.htm) for details about when it is necessary to file a final tax return.

## Deductions（控除）

This word means "subtracting a fixed monetary amount from a certain amount."
Correctly declaring deductions may reduce the amount of income tax and inhabitant tax you have to pay.
An explanation is provided at「[Types of deductions](https://knowledge.smarthr.jp/hc/ja/articles/360052694653#toc--13)」on this page about the types of deductions related to the year-end adjustment.

## Dependent relatives（扶養親族）

A dependent relative is a person who meets all the requirements below as of December 31 of that year.

- A relative other than a spouse (a relative by blood within the 6th degree and a relative by affinity within the 3rd degree), or a child you have been charged to raise by the prefectural governor (meaning a foster child), or an elderly person you have been charged to care for by the mayor of the municipality
- They are sharing living expenses with you (the taxpayer)
- Their annual total earnings amount is 480,000 yen or less
- They have never received payment in salary even once during that year as a family employee of a blue return taxpayer, or they are not a family employee of a white return taxpayer

Source：[No. 1180 Dependent deductions ｜ National Tax Agency](https://www.nta.go.jp/m/taxanswer/1180.htm)

:::tips
**What does「sharing living expenses」mean？**
It refers to a household living on a single budget.
It is not limited to situations where the person who will perform year-end adjustment and the people eligible for dependent deductions are living together.
Even if you usually live separately because you moved away from your family for work, are studying or are recuperating from a medical issue, if an allowance is being sent for living expenses, tuition fees or medical expenses, or if you spend long vacations together, then it is handled as a situation in which you are sharing living expenses.

Example: When buying a property worth 50 million yen

- The wife is the joint debtor

If the wife is a 「joint guarantor,」the wife is not a debtor and so she cannot apply for a housing loan deduction.

## Joint home loan（ペアローン）

When taking out a housing loan, both parties take out the housing loan and are designated as a joint guarantor for each other.
Example: When buying a property worth 50 million yen

- The husband and wife each borrow 25 million yen
- They are a joint guarantor for each other

For the above joint home loan case, the married couple are both responsible for repaying the loan as debtors, which means that both the husband and the wife can apply for a housing loan deduction.
